# UIToolkit-CustomEditor
A project I made to learn about editor scripting with the new UI Toolkit.

It contains a custom editor that allows easy editing of scriptable objects. In this case, the scriptable objects are cards with attack, defense and manacost values, descriptions, sprites and tiers (enum).

Features:

- Add & Remove cards
- Change all properties of said cards:
  - integer fields
  - text fields
  - enum field
  - object field 
- Preview/change the sprite associated with the card
- Search bar to look for cards by name
- Toolbar dropdown menu
